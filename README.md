Evaluate how the business behind a stock is doing using yfinance library https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance

## Step 1: How is the growth in the past

A good growth in the past shows the business is doing something right in the market. But if its growth is no better than Exchange-Traded Fund, why would I buy the stock?

The stock price in the past is compared to 

1. QQQ (the best growth ETF in my opinion) and 
2. SCHD (the best dividend ETF in my opinion)

## Step 2: Financial health examination.

Below is my checklist for financial health examination.

1. Growing revenue (preferablely > 10%)
2. Improved revenue quality (increased diversity, better revenue type)
3. Growing FCF: FCF stands for free cashflow
4. Growing OCF/S ratio: OCF stands for cashflow from operating, S is sales, i.e. revenue
5. Growing Net income/S ratio
6. Quick ratio (preferablely > 1)
7. FCF/long-term Debt ratio > 0.25
8. Decreasing Long-term debt
9. Decreasing outstanding shares

If a company can meet 6 of the above 9 criterias, I think its the financial health is strong.

## Step 3: Is it overvalued?
