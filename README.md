Evaluate how the business behind a stock is doing using yfinance library https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance

To make a conclusion whether you should buy the stock, **the following questions needs to be answered**. 

Keep in mind that “Investing is more art than science,” American investor Howard S. Marks is supposed to have said. So you should not just blindly follow my process of evaluating a stock.

Great invectors like Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Peter Lynch, Bill Ackman, Pat Dorsey keep emphasizing that you should do your own research on the business, listen to opinions that are different from theirs, and form your own opinion. Even the greatest investors like Buffet and Peter Lynch have wrong judgement about their investment, no one can avoid it. All you can do is do your due diligence, and maximize the chance of making the right investment, just like the way Warren Buffet does. That's also why I'm building this checklist for me to have a better judgement, and make an informed decision.

As Warren Buffet used to say, it's okay to miss out companies with great growth, but it's not okay if you buy a stock without understanding the business behind it. **If you don't understand the business, you are just gambling**.

“Charlie Munger has said that accumulating the first $100,000 from a standing start, with no seed money, is the most difficult part of building wealth. Making the first million was the next big hurdle. To do that, a person must consistently underspend his income. Getting wealthy, he explains, is like rolling a snowball. It helps to start on the top of a long hill—start early and try to roll that snowball for a very long time.”

— Janet Lowe, in Damn Right!: Behind the Scenes with Berkshire Hathaway Billionaire Charlie Munger

Getting your first 100,000 dolloars, save it and invest it, will change your life. The quicker you can hit that milestone, the better. This is the advice coming from the legendary investor and billionaire, Charlie Munger. The reason why Munger is advocating hitting $100,000 dollars mark as quickly as possible has to do with two very simple and powerful words: **compound interest**. The words compound interest are two of **the most magical words for your wealth building journey** once you truly understand the concept of compound interest it changes the way you view money. Compound interest is the interest on a deposit or loan calculated based on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. The definition is far from inspiring, and doesn't truly do compound interest justice. You can think of compound interest as a snowball rolling down a long hill you do the work of making the first little snowball while you are starting on the top of the hill. You then roll the snowball down the fill with each roll, the snowball is picking up more and more snow, and is getting larger and larger. And at the bottom of the long hill, the snowball is **massive compared to the tiny snowball you started out with you did no extra wrok in making the snowball**. You just rolled it down and let **time and gravity** do the work. 

The same concept applies to compound interest and wealth building. Let's say John saved $100,000 at the age of 30, and Mary saved 100,000 at the age of 40, both invested the money in the stock market with annual gain/interest of 10.72% (the S&P 500 for the years 1991 to 2020, the average stock market return for the last 30 years is 10.72%), and no extra yearly contribution/investment thereafter, how much difference in term of total value of money do yo think John and Mary will have when they both retire at the age of 65? It's a whopping $2,255,705.61. That is almost 2.3 millions difference.

John's initial investment of 100,000 after 65-30=35 years:

So do your research and start rolling your snowball, and let time do the wealth building work.


## Question 1: How is the growth in the past

A good growth in the past shows the business is doing something right in the market. But if its growth is no better than Exchange-Traded Fund, why would I bother buying the stock?

The stock price in the past is compared to 

1. QQQ (the best growth ETF in my opinion) and 
2. SCHD (the best dividend ETF in my opinion)

## Question 2: Financial health examination.

Below is my checklist for financial health examination.

1. Growing revenue (preferablely > 10%)
2. Improved revenue quality (increased diversity, better revenue type)
3. Growing FCF: FCF stands for free cashflow
4. Growing OCF/S ratio: OCF stands for cashflow from operating, S is sales, i.e. revenue
5. Growing Net income/S ratio
6. Quick ratio (preferablely > 1)
7. FCF/long-term Debt ratio > 0.25
8. Decreasing Long-term debt
9. Decreasing outstanding shares

If a company can meet 6 of the above 9 criterias, I think it's financially healthy

## Question 3: Is it overvalued?

Valuation methods typically fall into two main categories: 
1. absolute valuation, and
2. relative valuation.

I don't like using absolute valuation because it requires a lot of assumptions. Therefore here I'm only using relative valuation method.

## Question 4: Is there a wide moat around the business?

This is the **most important** step, and unfortunately it can't be evaluated quantatively by using numbers in income statement, balance sheet, and cashflow statement.

7 Powers by Hamilton Helmer(you can find the book on Amazon https://www.amazon.ca/7-Powers-Foundations-Business-Strategy/dp/0998116319) are used to determine how wide the moat is.

## Question 5: What are the risks?

This is the **second most important** step, and unfortunately it can't be evaluated quantatively neither.
Porter's Five Forces(You can find his book on Amazon https://www.amazon.ca/What-Strategy-Illustrated-Michael-Porter/dp/1633698238/ref=sr_1_6?crid=HJEFT70R6TBI&keywords=Porter%27s+Five+Forces&qid=1656604757&s=books&sprefix=porter%27s+five+forces%2Cstripbooks%2C58&sr=1-6) are used to evaluate the risks. Porter's Five Forces is a framework for analyzing a company's competitive environment. The Five Forces model is named after Harvard Business School professor, Michael E. Porter

## Question 6: How is the management team?

1. Is the CEO honest, trustworthy, transparent and open to discussions on issues and risks the company is facing
2. Skin in the game
3. Does the employees like the company? (Glassdoor review)

## Question 7: Are customers happy about the products/services?

Dollar-based retention rate, customer review websites.
