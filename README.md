Evaluate how the business behind a stock is doing using yfinance library https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance

To make a conclusion whether you should buy the stock, **the following questions needs to be answered**. 

Keep in mind that “Investing is more art than science,” American investor Howard S. Marks is supposed to have said. So you should not just blindly follow my process of evaluating a stock. You should do your own research, listen to opinions that are different from mine, and form your own opinion.

As Warren Buffet used to say, it's okay to miss out companies with great growth, but it's not okay if you buy a stock without understanding the business behind it. **If you don't understand the business, you are just gambling**.


## Step 1: How is the growth in the past

A good growth in the past shows the business is doing something right in the market. But if its growth is no better than Exchange-Traded Fund, why would I bother buying the stock?

The stock price in the past is compared to 

1. QQQ (the best growth ETF in my opinion) and 
2. SCHD (the best dividend ETF in my opinion)

## Step 2: Financial health examination.

Below is my checklist for financial health examination.

1. Growing revenue (preferablely > 10%)
2. Improved revenue quality (increased diversity, better revenue type)
3. Growing FCF: FCF stands for free cashflow
4. Growing OCF/S ratio: OCF stands for cashflow from operating, S is sales, i.e. revenue
5. Growing Net income/S ratio
6. Quick ratio (preferablely > 1)
7. FCF/long-term Debt ratio > 0.25
8. Decreasing Long-term debt
9. Decreasing outstanding shares

If a company can meet 6 of the above 9 criterias, I think it's financially healthy

## Step 3: Is it overvalued?

Valuation methods typically fall into two main categories: 
1. absolute valuation, and
2. relative valuation.

I don't like using absolute valuation because it requires a lot of assumptions. Therefore here I'm only using relative valuation method.

## Step 4: Is there a wide moat around the business?

This is the **most important** step, and unfortunately it can't be evaluated quantatively by using numbers in income statement, balance sheet, and cashflow statement.

7 Powers by Hamilton Helmer are used to determine how wide the moat is.

## Step 5: What are the risks?

This is the **second most important** step, and unfortunately it can't be evaluated quantatively neither.
Porter's Five Forces are used to evaluate the risks. Porter's Five Forces is a framework for analyzing a company's competitive environment. The Five Forces model is named after Harvard Business School professor, Michael E. Porter

## Step 6: How is the management team?

1. Is the CEO honest, trustworthy, transparent and open to discussions on issues and risks the company is facing
2. Skin in the game
3. Does the employees like the company? (Glassdoor review)

## Step 7: Are customers happy about the products/services?

Dollar-based retention rate, customer review websites.
